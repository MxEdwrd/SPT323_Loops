Hello! Thanks for reading this.

This includes instructions on how to compile your own Random Number Guessing Game if using my code from GitHub.

First, download all of the files in the repository.

Next, place the "main.rs" file in a folder named "src" (case sensitive) that is in the root folder with the other files.

You should now have four files (including .exe) and the src folder.

From there, open the Command Terminal and navigate to the root of the folder (the one that includes all of the files and src folder).

Next, type "cargo build" and it should build the entire program, notifying you of errors if there are any.

Your compiled program will be in the target\debug folder.

Enjoy and thanks!
